Simple Sensitivity analysis on "#Amazongo" tweets using R

The R code extracts specified number of tweets from twitter for a given search string and then compares the sentiments.
Classification of the sentiment of a tweet is based on the polarity of the individual words. This is determined by using postive and negative lexicon lists

P.S: It is not very accurate as the algorithm focuses on individual words rather than the overall context of the tweet.
